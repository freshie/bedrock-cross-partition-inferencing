Project: dual-routing-api-gateway
Environment: prod

Test Results Summary:
====================
❌ VPN Tunnel Status: FAIL
✅ Lambda Connectivity: PASS
✅ Network Connectivity: PASS

Recommendations:
===============
1. Ensure VPN tunnels are UP in both GovCloud and Commercial AWS
2. Verify route table configurations in both partitions
3. Check security group rules for Lambda and VPN traffic
4. Validate bearer token configuration in Secrets Manager
5. Test end-to-end connectivity with actual Bedrock API calls

Next Steps:
===========
- If tunnels are DOWN: Deploy Commercial AWS infrastructure
- If connectivity fails: Check routing and security groups
- If authentication fails: Update bearer token in Secrets Manager
- If successful: Proceed with API Gateway deployment
