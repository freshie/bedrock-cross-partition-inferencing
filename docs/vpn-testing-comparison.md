# VPN Lambda Testing: With vs Without Deployed Infrastructure

## Overview

This document explains how VPN Lambda testing works in two scenarios:
1. **Unit Testing** - Without deployed infrastructure (mocked)
2. **Integration Testing** - With deployed VPN infrastructure (real)

## Testing Scenarios Comparison

### 1. Unit Testing (Without Infrastructure)

**Script**: `./scripts/test-vpn-comprehensive.sh`

**What it tests**:
- ✅ Bearer token functionality
- ✅ VPC endpoint client initialization
- ✅ Request parsing and routing logic
- ✅ Bedrock request preparation
- ✅ Lambda handler GET requests
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

**Limitations**:
- 🔶 Uses mocked VPC endpoints
- 🔶 No real network connectivity
- 🔶 No actual AWS service integration
- 🔶 Cannot test VPN tunnel status
- 🔶 Limited to code logic validation

**Benefits**:
- ⚡ Fast execution (< 30 seconds)
- 💰 No AWS costs
- 🔧 Great for development and CI/CD
- 🐛 Easy debugging and iteration

### 2. Integration Testing (With Deployed Infrastructure)

**Script**: `./scripts/test-vpn-with-deployed-infrastructure.sh`

**What it tests**:
- ✅ Real VPC endpoint connectivity
- ✅ Actual VPN tunnel status
- ✅ Network routing within VPC
- ✅ AWS service integration (Secrets Manager, DynamoDB)
- ✅ Lambda function deployment in VPC
- ✅ End-to-end infrastructure validation

**Additional capabilities**:
- 🌐 Real DNS resolution testing
- 🔒 Security group validation
- 📊 VPN connection health monitoring
- 🏗️ CloudFormation stack validation
- 🚀 Deployed Lambda function testing

**Requirements**:
- 💰 AWS infrastructure costs
- ⏱️ Longer execution time (2-5 minutes)
- 🔧 Requires deployed VPN infrastructure
- 🎯 More complex setup and teardown

## Key Differences in Test Execution

### Unit Testing Flow
```bash
# 1. Set environment variables
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="your-token"

# 2. Run unit tests
./scripts/test-vpn-comprehensive.sh

# Tests run with:
# - Mocked VPC endpoints
# - Local Python imports
# - Simulated AWS responses
# - No network calls
```

### Integration Testing Flow
```bash
# 1. Deploy VPN infrastructure
./scripts/deploy-complete-vpn-infrastructure.sh

# 2. Set environment variables
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="your-token"

# 3. Run integration tests
./scripts/test-vpn-with-deployed-infrastructure.sh

# Tests run with:
# - Real VPC endpoints from CloudFormation
# - Actual network connectivity
# - Real AWS service calls
# - VPN tunnel validation
```

## Infrastructure Components Tested

### Without Infrastructure (Mocked)
| Component | Test Method | Validation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| VPC Endpoints | Mock objects | Logic only |
| VPN Connectivity | Simulated | Code paths |
| AWS Services | Mock responses | Request format |
| Network | No network calls | Parsing logic |
| Lambda Function | Local execution | Handler logic |

### With Infrastructure (Real)
| Component | Test Method | Validation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| VPC Endpoints | DNS resolution + connectivity | Real endpoints |
| VPN Connectivity | AWS API calls | Tunnel status |
| AWS Services | Actual service calls | Full integration |
| Network | Real network tests | Routing + security |
| Lambda Function | AWS Lambda invoke | Deployed function |

## Test Results Comparison

```

### Integration Test Results
```
✅ Infrastructure Details: PASSED
✅ VPN Connectivity: PASSED (tunnel status: UP)
✅ VPC Endpoints: PASSED (4/4 endpoints healthy)
✅ VPN Lambda Infrastructure: PASSED
✅ Deployed Lambda Function: PASSED

🎉 VPN INFRASTRUCTURE TESTING COMPLETED!
Execution time: ~3 minutes
```

## When to Use Each Testing Method

### Use Unit Testing When:
- 🔧 **Development**: Writing and debugging code
- 🚀 **CI/CD**: Automated testing in pipelines
- 💰 **Cost Control**: Avoiding AWS infrastructure costs
- ⚡ **Speed**: Need fast feedback loops
- 🐛 **Debugging**: Isolating code issues

### Use Integration Testing When:
- 🏗️ **Pre-deployment**: Validating infrastructure before production
- 🌐 **Network Issues**: Debugging connectivity problems
- 🔒 **Security**: Validating security group and VPC configurations
- 📊 **Performance**: Testing real-world latency and throughput
- 🎯 **End-to-end**: Validating complete system functionality

## Infrastructure Requirements

### For Unit Testing
```bash
# Required
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="your-token"

# Optional (for enhanced testing)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret"
```

### For Integration Testing
```bash
# Required infrastructure
- VPC with private subnets
- VPN Gateway and connection
- VPC endpoints for AWS services
- Security groups and routing tables
- Deployed Lambda function (optional)

# Required environment
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="your-token"
export AWS_REGION="us-gov-west-1"
```

## Cost Implications

### Unit Testing Costs
- **AWS Costs**: $0 (no infrastructure)
- **Time Cost**: ~15 seconds per run
- **Development Cost**: Low

### Integration Testing Costs
- **VPC**: ~$45/month (NAT Gateway)
- **VPN Gateway**: ~$36/month
- **VPC Endpoints**: ~$22/month (4 endpoints)
- **Lambda**: Pay per invocation
- **Total**: ~$103/month for testing infrastructure

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **Start with unit tests** for rapid development
2. **Use integration tests** before major deployments
3. **Run both** in CI/CD pipelines
4. **Monitor costs** for integration testing

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Daily development
./scripts/test-vpn-comprehensive.sh

# Pre-deployment validation
./scripts/deploy-complete-vpn-infrastructure.sh
./scripts/test-vpn-with-deployed-infrastructure.sh

# Production readiness
./scripts/test-end-to-end-routing.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Unit Test Issues
- **Import errors**: Check Python path and dependencies
- **Mock failures**: Verify mock setup and expectations
- **Logic errors**: Debug with print statements or debugger

### Integration Test Issues
- **VPN tunnel down**: Check AWS Console, may take 10-15 minutes
- **VPC endpoint failures**: Verify security groups and routing
- **Lambda deployment**: Check VPC configuration and permissions
- **Network connectivity**: Validate subnets and route tables

## Summary

Both testing methods are valuable:

- **Unit testing** provides fast, cost-effective validation of code logic
- **Integration testing** provides comprehensive validation of real infrastructure

The combination ensures both code quality and infrastructure reliability for the VPN Lambda system.
