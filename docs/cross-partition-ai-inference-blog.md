Government agencies and regulated industries operating in AWS GovCloud face a critical challenge in today's AI-driven landscape: accessing the latest and most capable AI models available in the AWS Commercial partition. While AWS GovCloud provides the security and compliance features required for sensitive workloads, it has limited availability of generative AI services like Amazon Bedrock compared to the commercial partition. This creates a significant barrier to AI innovation for organizations that must operate within strict compliance boundaries.

## The Challenge: Bridging the AI Gap

Digital transformation initiatives across government agencies increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to improve citizen services, enhance operational efficiency, and drive innovation. However, the specialized nature of AWS GovCloud, while essential for security and compliance, creates limitations that can hinder AI adoption:

**Limited AI Model Availability:** Fewer Amazon Bedrock models are available in GovCloud compared to commercial regions, with delayed rollout of new AI services and model versions. This means government agencies cannot access cutting-edge models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4, or the latest Nova models that could significantly enhance their applications.

**Innovation Constraints:** The slower adoption of new AI capabilities affects mission-critical applications and creates a competitive disadvantage in AI-driven initiatives. Government organizations find themselves unable to leverage the full spectrum of AI capabilities that could transform their service delivery.

**Compliance Requirements:** Despite these limitations, organizations must still maintain strict data governance, ensure data remains within approved boundaries, secure and audit all network traffic, and meet government access control standards.

## Delivering AI Innovation at Scale

To address these challenges, we've developed a comprehensive cross-partition AI inference architecture that enables GovCloud applications to securely access Amazon Bedrock services in the AWS Commercial partition. This solution maintains data sovereignty while providing access to the full range of AI models through three distinct architectural approaches, each designed for different security and performance requirements.

The solution leverages a proxy architecture that acts as a secure bridge between partitions, enabling organizations to access advanced AI capabilities without compromising their compliance posture. This approach allows government agencies to innovate with AI while maintaining the strict security controls required for their sensitive workloads.

## Architecture Overview: Three Paths to Cross-Partition AI Access

Our solution provides three implementation options, allowing organizations to choose the approach that best fits their security requirements, performance needs, and implementation timeline.

### Option 1: MVP - Internet-Based Connectivity

The Minimum Viable Product approach provides the fastest path to cross-partition AI access using HTTPS connections over the public internet, prioritizing speed of implementation while maintaining essential security controls.

This architecture demonstrates how GovCloud applications can quickly access commercial AI services through a serverless proxy. The solution includes:

1. **GovCloud applications** send requests to API Gateway for authentication and routing
2. **Lambda function** acts as a cross-partition proxy, retrieving credentials from Secrets Manager
3. **HTTPS calls** to Amazon Bedrock in the commercial partition over the public internet
4. **Comprehensive logging** through CloudWatch for audit and monitoring requirements

**Key Benefits:**
- **Rapid Implementation**: Can be deployed in 1-2 weeks
- **Cost Effective**: Minimal infrastructure requirements with pay-per-use model
