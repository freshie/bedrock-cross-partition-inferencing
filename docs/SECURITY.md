## 🚨 **Reporting a Vulnerability**

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 **Private Disclosure**
**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:
1. **Email**: Create a private GitHub issue with the "security" label
2. **Include**: Detailed description of the vulnerability
3. **Provide**: Steps to reproduce (if safe to do so)
4. **Timeline**: We aim to respond within 48 hours

### 📋 **What to Include**
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce (if safe)
- **Environment**: Version, deployment method, AWS region
- **Mitigation**: Any temporary workarounds you've identified

### ⏰ **Response Timeline**
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues

## 🎯 **Security Scope**

### ✅ **In Scope**
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Data exposure vulnerabilities
- Injection attacks (code, command, etc.)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) in documentation
- Insecure cryptographic implementations
- AWS IAM permission escalations
- Secrets management vulnerabilities

### ❌ **Out of Scope**
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Denial of service attacks
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to upstream)
- Theoretical attacks without practical impact

## 🔧 **Security Best Practices**

### 🏗️ **For Deployment**
- Use least-privilege IAM policies
- Enable CloudTrail logging
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Monitor CloudWatch for anomalies
- Use VPC endpoints where possible

### 💻 **For Development**
- Never commit real credentials
- Sanitize all logs and examples
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data
- Enable MFA on all AWS accounts
- Regular security reviews of code changes
