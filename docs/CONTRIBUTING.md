2. Update main README if needed
3. Add to relevant guides and references
4. Ensure consistent formatting

## üîß Development Tools

### Useful Scripts
```bash
# Validate project setup
./scripts/validate-setup.sh

# Run comprehensive tests
./scripts/run-comprehensive-validation.sh

# Security scanning
./scripts/security-scan.sh
