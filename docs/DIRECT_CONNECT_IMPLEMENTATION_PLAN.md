# Direct Connect Implementation Plan

## üéØ Overview

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for deploying the **Direct Connect architecture** for cross-partition Bedrock inference. Unlike the Internet and VPN approaches that can be deployed with automated scripts, Direct Connect requires physical infrastructure coordination with AWS and careful planning.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Summary

The Direct Connect architecture provides **enterprise-grade performance and security** by establishing a dedicated network connection between AWS GovCloud and Commercial partitions, eliminating internet dependency and providing consistent, high-bandwidth connectivity.

### üîÑ **How Direct Connect Differs from VPN**

| Aspect | VPN Architecture | Direct Connect Architecture |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **Connection Type** | IPSec tunnels over internet | Dedicated physical connection |
| **Bandwidth** | Up to 1.25Gbps | 1Gbps to 100Gbps |
| **Latency** | 300-600ms (variable) | 50-200ms (consistent) |
| **Setup Time** | 1-2 days | 2-8 weeks |
| **Monthly Cost** | $75-200 | $300-2,500+ |
| **Reliability** | Internet-dependent | Dedicated circuit |

**Key Point:** Direct Connect uses the **same Lambda functions and VPC infrastructure** as the VPN architecture, but replaces the VPN tunnel with a dedicated network connection.

## üìã Prerequisites

### üè¢ **Organizational Requirements**
- **AWS Enterprise Support** (required for Direct Connect setup)
- **Network engineering expertise** for BGP and routing configuration
- **Physical data center presence** or colocation facility access

```

### **Phase 2: AWS Direct Connect Setup (Week 2-4)**

#### **2.1 Create Direct Connect Gateway**
```bash
# Create Direct Connect Gateway in Commercial AWS
aws directconnect create-direct-connect-gateway \
  --name "govcloud-commercial-dxgw" \
  --amazon-side-asn 64512

# Associate with Commercial VPC Virtual Gateway
aws directconnect create-direct-connect-gateway-association \
  --direct-connect-gateway-id "dxgw-12345678" \
  --associated-gateway-id "vgw-87654321"
```

#### **2.2 Order Direct Connect Port**
```bash
# Order through AWS Console or API
- Location: Choose Direct Connect facility
- Port Speed: 1Gbps, 10Gbps, 50Gbps, or 100Gbps
- Connection Name: "GovCloud-Commercial-CrossPartition"
- Additional bandwidth: Can be added later
```

#### **2.3 Configure Virtual Interface (VIF)**
```bash
# Create Private VIF for cross-partition connectivity
aws directconnect create-private-virtual-interface \
  --connection-id "dxcon-12345678" \
  --new-private-virtual-interface '{
    "virtualInterfaceName": "govcloud-commercial-vif",
    "vlan": 100,
    "asn": 65000,
    "authKey": "optional-bgp-key",
    "amazonAddress": "192.168.1.1/30",
    "customerAddress": "192.168.1.2/30",
    "addressFamily": "ipv4",
    "directConnectGatewayId": "dxgw-12345678"
  }'
```

### **Phase 3: Network Infrastructure (Week 3-5)**

#### **3.1 Colocation and Cross-Connect Setup**
```bash
# Physical infrastructure requirements:
- Rack space in Direct Connect facility
- Network equipment (routers, switches)
- Cross-connect cable to AWS cage
- Power and cooling requirements
- Remote hands support contract
```

#### **3.2 BGP Configuration**
```bash
# Configure BGP on your router
router bgp 65000

 neighbor 192.168.1.1 password optional-bgp-key
 
 address-family ipv4
  network 10.0.0.0/16  # GovCloud VPC CIDR
  neighbor 192.168.1.1 activate
  neighbor 192.168.1.1 soft-reconfiguration inbound
 exit-address-family
```

#### **3.3 Routing Configuration**
```bash
# Configure routing between partitions
# GovCloud side routing
ip route 10.1.0.0/16 192.168.1.1  # Commercial VPC

# Commercial side routing (via Direct Connect Gateway)
# Automatically propagated via BGP
```

### **Phase 4: Lambda and VPC Configuration (Week 4-6)**

#### **4.1 Deploy VPC Infrastructure**
```bash
# Use existing VPN CloudFormation templates
# The same VPC infrastructure works for Direct Connect
./scripts/deploy-vpn-infrastructure.sh

# Key components deployed:
- Commercial VPC (10.1.0.0/16)
- Private subnets in multiple AZs
- VPC endpoints for Bedrock, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch
- Security groups for cross-partition traffic
```

#### **4.2 Update Route Tables**
```bash
# Update VPC route tables to use Direct Connect Gateway
aws ec2 create-route \
  --route-table-id "rtb-12345678" \
  --destination-cidr-block "10.0.0.0/16" \
  --gateway-id "dxgw-12345678"
```

#### **4.3 Deploy Lambda Functions**
```bash
# Use existing VPN Lambda deployment
# Same Lambda function works for Direct Connect
./scripts/deploy-dual-routing-vpn-lambda.sh

# The Lambda function will automatically use Direct Connect
# when VPN tunnels are replaced with Direct Connect routing
```

### **Phase 5: Testing and Validation (Week 5-7)**

#### **5.1 Connectivity Testing**
```bash
# Test Direct Connect connectivity
aws directconnect describe-connections

```

#### **5.2 Cross-Partition Testing**
```bash
# Test Lambda connectivity through Direct Connect
./scripts/test-vpn-lambda-integration.sh

# Test end-to-end Bedrock access
./scripts/test-end-to-end-routing.sh

# Performance testing
./scripts/run-performance-comparison.sh
```

#### **5.3 Performance Validation**
```bash
# Expected performance improvements:

- Bandwidth: Up to port speed (1-100Gbps)
- Jitter: <5ms (vs variable on VPN)
- Packet loss: <0.01% (vs variable on internet)
```

### **Phase 6: Production Deployment (Week 6-8)**

  --alarm-name "DirectConnect-ConnectionState" \
  --alarm-description "Direct Connect connection down" \
  --metric-name "ConnectionState" \
  --namespace "AWS/DX" \
  --statistic "Maximum" \
  --period 300 \
  --threshold 0 \
  --comparison-operator "LessThanThreshold"
```

#### **6.3 Documentation and Runbooks**
```bash
# Create operational documentation:
- Network diagrams with Direct Connect topology
- BGP configuration backup and restore procedures
- Failover and recovery procedures
- Performance baseline documentation
- Troubleshooting guides
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### **Lambda Function Modifications**
The existing VPN Lambda function requires **no code changes** for Direct Connect. The routing change is transparent to the application layer.

```python
# Same Lambda function works for both VPN and Direct Connect
# The function uses VPC endpoints which route through Direct Connect
# when VPN is replaced with Direct Connect Gateway
```

### **VPC Endpoint Configuration**
```bash
# Same VPC endpoints used for VPN work with Direct Connect
- com.amazonaws.us-east-1.bedrock-runtime
- com.amazonaws.us-east-1.secretsmanager
- com.amazonaws.us-east-1.logs
- com.amazonaws.us-east-1.monitoring

# Traffic automatically routes through Direct Connect
# when Direct Connect Gateway is configured
```

### **Security Group Updates**
```json
{
  "GroupName": "direct-connect-bedrock-sg",
  "Description": "Allow Direct Connect cross-partition traffic",
  "VpcId": "vpc-12345678",

- AWS Direct Connect ports (2): $0
- Cross-connects (2): $1,000 (one-time)
- Network equipment: $75,000 (one-time)
- Professional services: $100,000 (one-time)
Total Setup: $176,000

Monthly Costs:
- Direct Connect ports (2): $4,500/month
- Cross-connects (2): $400/month
- Colocation: $800/month
Total Monthly: $5,700/month

3-Year Total: $176,000 + ($5,700 √ó 36) = $381,200
```

### **ROI Calculation**
```bash
# Break-even analysis for 10Gbps Direct Connect:
# Assumptions: 1,000 concurrent users, 8 hours/day usage

Cost per user per month: $5,700 / 1,000 = $5.70
Cost per user per hour: $5.70 / (8 √ó 30) = $0.024

# Compare to cloud alternatives:
# If equivalent cloud AI service costs >$0.024/user/hour,
# Direct Connect provides positive ROI
```
