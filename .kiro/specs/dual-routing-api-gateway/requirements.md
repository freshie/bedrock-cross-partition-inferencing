# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements separate API Gateway paths to support both internet-based and VPN-based routing for cross-partition AI inference. The solution will maintain the existing internet routing while adding new VPN routing paths, providing clear separation and independent monitoring capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Maintain Existing Internet Routing

**User Story:** As an existing API client, I want my current API calls to continue working unchanged, so that there is no disruption to my service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing clients call `/v1/bedrock/invoke-model` THEN the system SHALL route requests via internet to Commercial Bedrock
2. WHEN existing clients use current authentication methods THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully without changes
3. WHEN existing clients receive responses THEN the response format SHALL remain identical to current implementation
4. WHEN monitoring existing endpoints THEN all current metrics and logging SHALL continue to function

### Requirement 2: Add New VPN Routing Paths

**User Story:** As a security-conscious API client, I want to access AI inference through secure VPN paths, so that my data never traverses the public internet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clients call `/v1/vpn/bedrock/invoke-model` THEN the system SHALL route requests via VPN to Commercial Bedrock
2. WHEN VPN routing is used THEN all traffic SHALL flow through encrypted VPN tunnels
3. WHEN VPN endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL use VPC endpoints for all AWS service communication
4. WHEN VPN routing fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages without falling back to internet routing

### Requirement 3: Independent Lambda Functions

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want separate Lambda functions for internet and VPN routing, so that I can monitor, scale, and troubleshoot each routing method independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN there SHALL be two distinct Lambda functions: internet-routing and vpn-routing
2. WHEN the internet Lambda function experiences issues THEN the VPN Lambda function SHALL remain unaffected
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN each Lambda function SHALL scale independently based on its traffic patterns
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN each routing method SHALL have separate CloudWatch metrics and logs

### Requirement 4: API Gateway Path Structure

**User Story:** As an API client, I want clear and intuitive API paths, so that I can easily choose between internet and VPN routing methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing internet routing THEN the path SHALL be `/v1/bedrock/invoke-model`
2. WHEN accessing VPN routing THEN the path SHALL be `/v1/vpn/bedrock/invoke-model`
3. WHEN calling either endpoint THEN the request/response format SHALL be identical except for the routing path
4. WHEN documenting the API THEN both endpoints SHALL be clearly documented with their routing methods

### Requirement 5: Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want consistent authentication across both routing methods, so that access control policies are uniformly enforced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clients authenticate to either endpoint THEN the same authentication mechanisms SHALL be supported
2. WHEN API keys are used THEN they SHALL work for both internet and VPN endpoints
3. WHEN IAM roles are used THEN they SHALL have appropriate permissions for both routing methods
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN both endpoints SHALL return consistent error responses

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring for both routing methods, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in either routing method THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail and context
2. WHEN monitoring system health THEN separate dashboards SHALL be available for internet and VPN routing
3. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN they SHALL clearly identify which routing method is affected
4. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN logs SHALL contain sufficient information to trace requests through the entire flow

### Requirement 7: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As an API client, I want both routing methods to provide reliable and performant service, so that my applications can depend on consistent response times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using internet routing THEN performance SHALL match or exceed current baseline metrics
2. WHEN using VPN routing THEN response times SHALL be within 20% of internet routing performance
3. WHEN either routing method experiences high load THEN the system SHALL scale appropriately
4. WHEN one routing method fails THEN it SHALL not impact the availability of the other method

### Requirement 8: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities for both routing methods, so that I can validate functionality and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN there SHALL be test suites for both internet and VPN routing
2. WHEN comparing routing methods THEN automated tests SHALL validate functional equivalence
3. WHEN performance testing THEN both routing methods SHALL be tested under similar load conditions
4. WHEN deploying changes THEN automated validation SHALL verify both routing paths are functional
