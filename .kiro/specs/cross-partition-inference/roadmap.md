## Deferred Requirements (Moved from MVP)

### Advanced Network Connectivity
**Original Requirement 7**: Network administrator configuration of secure network paths

**Rationale for Deferral**: 
- MVP focuses on internet-based connectivity for simplicity
- VPN and Direct Connect require significant additional infrastructure
- Internet connectivity with TLS 1.3 provides adequate security for initial deployment
- Advanced networking can be added in Phase 3 without breaking existing functionality

### Multi-Network Path Configuration
**Original Requirement 3 (partial)**: Administrator choice between internet, VPN, or Direct Connect

**Rationale for Deferral**:
- Internet-only approach reduces complexity and deployment time
- Network path selection adds significant configuration overhead
- Can be implemented as an enhancement without changing core architecture
- Allows for faster MVP delivery and user feedback

## Migration Strategy

### From Phase 1 to Phase 2
- Existing Lambda functions can be enhanced without breaking changes
- Additional IAM policies can be layered on top of existing roles
- UI can be extended with new security features

### From Phase 2 to Phase 3
- Lambda functions will need to be migrated to VPC for advanced networking
- Additional infrastructure components (VPN Gateway, Direct Connect Gateway)
- Network routing configuration and testing required

### From Phase 3 to Phase 4
- Multi-region deployment requires infrastructure replication
- Load balancing and failover mechanisms
- Cross-region data synchronization for audit logs

## Success Metrics by Phase

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Successful cross-partition requests > 95%
- Average request latency < 3 seconds
- Zero security incidents
- UI dashboard adoption by admin users

### Phase 2 (Enhanced Security)
- Automated credential rotation working
- Compliance audit pass rate > 98%
- Reduced manual security operations

### Phase 3 (Advanced Networking)
- VPN/Direct Connect latency improvement > 50%
- Network path availability > 99.9%
- Reduced data transfer costs

### Phase 4 (Enterprise)
- Multi-region failover time < 30 seconds
- System availability > 99.99%
- Cost optimization savings > 20%

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Phase 2 Dependencies
- AWS Config setup for compliance monitoring
- Integration with enterprise identity provider
- Security team approval for automated credential rotation

### Phase 3 Dependencies
- Network team setup of VPN or Direct Connect
- VPC design and subnet allocation
- Network security group and NACL configuration

### Phase 4 Dependencies
- Multi-region AWS account setup
- Disaster recovery procedures and testing
- Enterprise monitoring tool integration

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Lambda cold starts**: Implement provisioned concurrency in Phase 4
- **Network connectivity**: Implement health checks and failover in Phase 3
- **Credential management**: Automated rotation and monitoring in Phase 2

### Security Risks
- **Data exposure**: Enhanced encryption and audit logging in Phase 2
- **Unauthorized access**: Advanced IAM and MFA in Phase 2
- **Network attacks**: Private networking options in Phase 3

### Operational Risks
- **Complexity growth**: Maintain clear documentation and automation
- **Cost escalation**: Implement cost monitoring and optimization in Phase 4
- **Skill gaps**: Training and knowledge transfer planning
