# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables AWS GovCloud users to access GenAI and Bedrock models from the commercial partition when local resources are constrained or unavailable. The solution provides a secure, compliant bridge that allows cross-partition inferencing while maintaining proper security boundaries and audit trails.

## Requirements

### MVP Requirement

**User Story:** As a GovCloud developer, I want a simple way to connect to commercial Bedrock endpoints using stored credentials, so that I can quickly access commercial models for testing and development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the MVP THEN the system SHALL store commercial AWS credentials in AWS Secrets Manager within GovCloud
2. WHEN making cross-partition requests THEN the system SHALL retrieve credentials from Secrets Manager and authenticate to commercial Bedrock endpoints
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL provide a simple proxy interface that forwards Bedrock API calls to commercial partition
4. WHEN responses are returned THEN the system SHALL pass through commercial Bedrock responses with minimal modification
5. IF credentials are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return authentication errors and log the failure

### MVP UI Requirement

**User Story:** As a GovCloud administrator, I want a web UI running in GovCloud that shows inference requests and their origins, so that I can monitor cross-partition activity in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the UI THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard showing all inference requests in real-time
2. WHEN viewing requests THEN the UI SHALL show the source partition (GovCloud or Commercial) for each request
3. WHEN displaying request details THEN the UI SHALL show timestamp, model used, request size, response time, and success/failure status
4. WHEN requests are made THEN the UI SHALL update in real-time without requiring page refresh
5. WHEN filtering requests THEN the UI SHALL allow filtering by partition, model, time range, and success status
6. IF running in GovCloud THEN the UI SHALL be accessible via a GovCloud URL and show "Running in GovCloud" in the interface
7. WHEN showing request origins THEN the UI SHALL clearly indicate whether the Bedrock request came from Commercial partition or GovCloud partition

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a GovCloud developer, I want to access commercial partition Bedrock models, so that I can use the latest AI models not yet available in GovCloud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a model not available in GovCloud THEN the system SHALL route the request to the commercial partition
2. WHEN routing to commercial partition THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs of all cross-partition requests
3. WHEN a cross-partition request is made THEN the system SHALL authenticate and authorize the request using proper IAM roles
4. IF a model is available in both partitions THEN the system SHALL prefer the GovCloud instance by default

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system manager, I want to control which users and applications can access cross-partition inference, so that I can maintain security boundaries and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system manager SHALL be able to whitelist specific IAM roles, users, or applications for cross-partition access
2. WHEN a non-authorized user attempts cross-partition access THEN the system SHALL deny the request and log the security event
3. WHEN managing permissions THEN the system manager SHALL be able to grant time-limited access with automatic expiration
4. IF no user authorization is configured THEN the system SHALL deny all cross-partition requests by default

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a GovCloud administrator, I want to configure which models can be used for cross-partition access, so that I can maintain security and compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to whitelist specific models for cross-partition access
2. WHEN a non-whitelisted model is requested THEN the system SHALL deny the request and log the attempt
3. WHEN connecting to commercial partition THEN the system SHALL use secure HTTPS connections over the internet
4. IF model whitelisting is not configured THEN the system SHALL allow all available Bedrock models by default

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a GovCloud user, I want to opt-in to cross-partition inference with transparent failover, so that my applications can access commercial resources when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants cross-partition access THEN they SHALL explicitly opt-in through configuration or API parameters
2. WHEN a GovCloud model request fails due to capacity AND user has opted-in THEN the system SHALL attempt commercial partition if authorized
3. WHEN failover occurs THEN the system SHALL log the failover event with reason and timestamp
4. IF user has not opted-in THEN the system SHALL return the original GovCloud error without attempting commercial access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want complete traceability of what data goes to commercial partition and where it's stored, so that I can ensure compliance with data governance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making cross-partition requests THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.3 or higher
2. WHEN data is sent to commercial partition THEN the system SHALL log detailed metadata including data classification, size, and destination
3. WHEN commercial partition stores data THEN the system SHALL track storage location, retention policies, and access patterns
4. WHEN audit logs are created THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, user identity, data fingerprint, model requested, partition used, and network path
5. IF data contains sensitive classifications THEN the system SHALL apply additional encryption and logging requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use existing Bedrock SDK calls with minimal changes, so that I can easily integrate cross-partition capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using standard Bedrock SDK THEN the system SHALL provide a compatible interface with opt-in parameters
2. WHEN responses are returned THEN the system SHALL maintain the same response format as native Bedrock with additional metadata headers
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standard Bedrock error codes and messages with partition context
4. IF cross-partition access is requested THEN the system SHALL require explicit opt-in parameters in the API call



### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an operations team member, I want to monitor cross-partition usage, performance, and data flows, so that I can optimize costs and ensure compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cross-partition requests are made THEN the system SHALL track latency metrics for each partition and network path
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide usage statistics by model, partition, user, data classification, and time period
3. WHEN costs are incurred THEN the system SHALL track and report cross-partition usage costs separately including network transfer costs
4. WHEN data flows occur THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing data movement patterns, volumes, and storage locations
5. IF performance degrades or data governance violations occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators with specific metrics and recommendations
