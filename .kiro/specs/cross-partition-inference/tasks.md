# Implementation Plan

This implementation plan focuses on the MVP (internet-based) cross-partition inference solution with a basic web UI dashboard. The goal is to get a working system quickly with minimal complexity.

## MVP Core Tasks (Simplified)

- [x] 1. Create basic Lambda proxy for cross-partition requests



  - Set up Python Lambda with boto3 for Bedrock client
  - Retrieve commercial credentials from Secrets Manager
  - Forward requests to commercial Bedrock over HTTPS
  - Log requests to DynamoDB with partition info (govcloud â†’ commercial)



  - _Requirements: MVP Requirement, MVP UI Requirement_

- [x] 2. Set up API Gateway and IAM



  - Create REST API with Lambda proxy integration
  - Configure IAM authentication for API access
  - Set up Lambda execution role with minimal permissions
  - _Requirements: MVP Requirement, Requirement 2_




- [x] 3. Add Bedrock models discovery API
  - Create GET endpoint to list available Commercial Bedrock models
  - Use list_foundation_models API to get model capabilities
  - Return model information including supported features
  - Add proper error handling and logging
  - _Requirements: MVP Requirement, Model Discovery_

- [x] 4. Deploy and test end-to-end
  - Create comprehensive CloudFormation template for all resources
  - Deploy Lambda functions and API Gateway
  - Test cross-partition calls and models discovery
  - Verify all API endpoints work correctly
  - _Requirements: MVP Requirement, Model Discovery_
