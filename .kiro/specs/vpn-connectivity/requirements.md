# VPN Connectivity Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Site-to-Site VPN connectivity between AWS GovCloud and Commercial partitions to enable secure, private cross-partition AI inference. This builds upon the existing internet-based solution by adding network-level security and private connectivity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: VPN Infrastructure Setup

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want to establish encrypted VPN tunnels between GovCloud and Commercial partitions, so that all cross-partition AI traffic flows through private, secure connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying VPN infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create Customer Gateways in both partitions
2. WHEN establishing VPN connections THEN the system SHALL create redundant tunnels for high availability
3. WHEN VPN tunnels are established THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity using ping tests
4. IF VPN tunnel fails THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to backup tunnel
5. WHEN VPN is operational THEN the system SHALL route all Bedrock traffic through private subnets

### Requirement 2: Private Subnet Architecture with VPC Endpoints in Both Partitions

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want Lambda functions deployed in private subnets with comprehensive VPC endpoints in both GovCloud and Commercial partitions, so that no traffic flows over the public internet and no NAT gateways are required in either partition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying GovCloud Lambda functions THEN the system SHALL place them in private subnets with no internet gateway access
2. WHEN deploying Commercial Lambda functions THEN the system SHALL place them in private subnets with no internet gateway access
3. WHEN GovCloud Lambda needs AWS services THEN the system SHALL use GovCloud VPC endpoints for all required services
4. WHEN Commercial Lambda needs AWS services THEN the system SHALL use Commercial VPC endpoints for all required services
5. WHEN accessing Secrets Manager from GovCloud THEN the system SHALL use GovCloud VPC endpoint to retrieve credentials privately
6. WHEN writing to DynamoDB from GovCloud THEN the system SHALL use GovCloud VPC endpoint for audit logging
7. WHEN using CloudWatch from either partition THEN the system SHALL use partition-specific VPC endpoints for logging and metrics
8. WHEN routing cross-partition traffic THEN the system SHALL use route tables directing traffic through VPN tunnels
9. IF any service lacks VPC endpoint support THEN the system SHALL document alternative private access methods
10. WHEN monitoring network traffic THEN the system SHALL confirm zero NAT gateway usage in both partitions

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Security Controls

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want network-level security controls and monitoring, so that I can demonstrate secure cross-partition communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing VPN THEN the system SHALL use IPSec encryption with AES-256
2. WHEN configuring security groups THEN the system SHALL allow only necessary ports and protocols
3. WHEN monitoring traffic THEN the system SHALL log all VPN tunnel activity
4. WHEN detecting anomalies THEN the system SHALL alert security teams
5. WHEN auditing THEN the system SHALL provide complete network flow logs

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want consistent, low-latency connectivity, so that AI inference performance is predictable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing VPN THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate bandwidth allocation
2. WHEN routing traffic THEN the system SHALL optimize for lowest latency paths
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track latency and throughput metrics
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust routing
5. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL maintain performance characteristics

### Requirement 5: VPC Endpoint Coverage for All AWS Services in Both Partitions

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious administrator, I want comprehensive VPC endpoint coverage for all AWS services used by the solution in both GovCloud and Commercial partitions, so that I can eliminate NAT gateway costs and maintain complete private connectivity across partitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying GovCloud infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create VPC endpoints for Secrets Manager, DynamoDB, CloudWatch Logs, and CloudWatch Metrics
2. WHEN deploying Commercial infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create VPC endpoints for Bedrock, CloudWatch Logs, and CloudWatch Metrics
3. WHEN Lambda functions execute in GovCloud THEN the system SHALL route all AWS API calls through GovCloud VPC endpoints
4. WHEN Lambda functions execute in Commercial THEN the system SHALL route all AWS API calls through Commercial VPC endpoints
5. WHEN cross-partition communication occurs THEN the system SHALL use VPN tunnels for partition-to-partition traffic only
6. WHEN monitoring costs THEN the system SHALL show zero NAT gateway charges in both partitions
7. WHEN validating connectivity THEN the system SHALL confirm all services accessible via private IPs in both partitions
8. IF new AWS services are added THEN the system SHALL automatically provision required VPC endpoints in the appropriate partition

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want the VPN solution to work with existing API interfaces, so that I don't need to change my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying VPN solution THEN the system SHALL maintain existing API Gateway endpoints
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL use the same request/response formats
3. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL use existing IAM and API key mechanisms
4. WHEN logging THEN the system SHALL maintain existing audit trail formats
5. WHEN migrating THEN the system SHALL provide seamless transition from internet-based solution
